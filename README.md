# 🧪 Air Quality Analysis of Indian Cities

This project performs data analysis and visualization on air pollution data from major Indian cities. It explores key pollutants such as **PM2.5**, **PM10**, **NO₂**, and **CO**, and provides insights into air quality trends using Python.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Load and preprocess real-world air quality data
- Handle missing values, date formatting, and outliers
- Analyze pollutant patterns across different Indian cities
- Visualize pollution trends using various graphs
- Extract meaningful environmental insights

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- PM2.5 trend over time (line plot)
- Top 5 most polluted cities (bar chart)
- Pollutant correlation heatmap
- City-wise PM2.5 distribution (boxplot)
- PM2.5 contribution by city (pie chart)

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Air Quality Data in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india)
- **Format:** CSV  
- The dataset includes pollution data collected over several years from multiple Indian cities.

---

## 🔍 Sample Insights

- Cities like Delhi consistently report the highest average PM2.5 levels.
- Seasonal trends show pollution spikes during winter months.
- PM2.5 and PM10 exhibit a high correlation, suggesting similar pollution sources.

---

## 🌱 Future Scope

- Integrate **real-time air quality APIs** (e.g., OpenAQ) for live dashboards
- Perform **seasonal decomposition and forecasting** of pollution levels
- Extend analysis to **predictive modeling** using machine learning
- Build a **public dashboard** using Plotly or Streamlit
- Explore **health impact correlations** with hospital admission rates
